# Traffic-Light-Controller-on-8051-Microcontroller-using-Assembly-Language-
This project uses an 8051 microcontroller to control a traffic light system. Written in assembly language, it manages the traffic light sequence (green, yellow, red) for cars and pedestrians. The microcontroller cycles through each light with specific timing to ensure smooth traffic flow and safety at intersections.
